      \ Persona Jessica Drives Again (to Death, Sister): SWEET, SWEET LONELY GIRL (2016)</title><text>Rolling through the ghostly corridors of a lonely girl's small town 70s American mind, via director A.D. Calvo, rides a retro-homage to the young girl-sunk-to-madness\
      \ horror films of auld. SWEET, SWEET LONELY GIRL (2016) exudes such a confidently lyrical, intertextual, and retro-pastorale poetry over its nicely brief running time (78 minutes) that one can forgive it not really having anything new or coherent to say.\
      \ It builds up and works and delivers its scares and moments of quiet beauty, with cinematography that masterfully evokes the 70s work of early Vilmos Zsigmond and two captivating performances by Erin Wilhelmi and Quinn Shepherd. SWEET is a 'Shudder Exclusive'\
      \ and worth the $4.99 a month if that's what it takes, as Shudder is like a benchmark of cool horror -- it's curated, not just the dregs of some company's catalogue, and you can tell its lovingly curated by fans in the know by their selection. Not to be\
      \ pluggy, but it's relevant to the casket hand.    Sent by her weary mother to work as a helper for a secretive (and wealthy) shut-in aunt in her big, eerie Victorian house (above), bookworm Adele (Wilhelmi) tries to reconnect but the bitchy aunt insists\
      \ on merely leaving demanding notes slid under her door. Is she even her aunt or some creepy monster hiding itself in there? If you've seen any movie made in the 70s, you'll naturally be suspicious. The house is big and very still and lonesome and the\
      \ Gothic gloom of Adele's situation begins to get to us almost immediately. But Adele, Bronte-esque as she is, bops along listening to lit FM pop songs on her possibly slightly anachronistic walkman. And... wait, who's that chick?   It's Beth (Quinn Shepherd),\
      \ rocking a delectable 70s midriff at the local grocery store and holding an apple and the gaze of a shop clerk; later, in a gloomy bar, the two girls strike up a friendship and soon Beth is dropping by the Victorian \_mansion and bad influencing Adele\
      \ into all sorts of things, until it's too late to extract her persona from the vortex. Not that we want her to, but what's the deal? Don't think about it, just enjoy the eerie vibe Calvo generates using little more than deep shadow--such as the dark,\
      \ empty nearly Edward Hopper-esque chasm space of the local watering hole.     The 'two opposite female personas melting into one another' artsy subgenre of the 60s-70s, the 'wild free spirit helps alienated young wallflower open' lesbian after-school\
      \ 70s special episode; and the horror 'is this all a dream of Jane Eyre's crazy attic dweller post-Lewton Victorian Gothic' and the REPULSION-ish \"distortedly loud ambient sound\" genre--they're all here. Fans of 60s-70s feminine psyche horror mind-fuckery\
      \ like LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH and BURNT OFFERINGS will love, as I did, mostly, the dallying through the graveyard with their brass rubbing materials, having long sapphic gazes, trying on Victorian attic clothes, and trying to get a peek at the agoraphobic\
      \ invalid behind the door at the top of the stairs, or the child's corpse in the graveyard. Just because loving these films you'll also spot foreshadowing and predict future scares doesn't make them less enjoyable when they come, especially as Calvo makes\
      \ no attempt to hide them or reference their sources. The erotic story of a beach tryst Beth tells Adele during their getaway is lifted wholesale from PERSONA (1966), which is then seen, briefly, very very briefly, on TV, and further checked via some 'was\
      \ their lesbian tryst / psychic merge a dream or real?' facial merging. Things start to get really real when... well, I've said too much.  Beth in bed at the cabin (Note Pazuzu on night table at left)   All in all SWEET isn't necessarily a game-changer\
      \ but it's beautifully filmed and does strike the kind of deep mythic chord even quoting directly--from split-female psyche films like Bergman's PERSONA (1966), GO ASK ALICE, Lynch's TWIN PEAKS and MULHOLLAND DRIVE (2001), cracker factory girl bombs like\_\
      REPULSION (1965),\_CARNIVAL OF SOULS\_(1968),\_LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH\_(1972),\_BURNT OFFERINGS\_(1976), the \"A Drop of Water\" segment from Bava's BLACK SABBATH (1963), and of course the\_1970-72 lesbian vampire 'Carmilla-wave.'\_In fact if you're\
      \ a classic horror fan who know these films, it's pretty fun spotting all the influences and references. If there's not a lot else going on other than the trope-checking and excellent cinematography by Ryan Parker, who cares? Just seeing any movie that\
      \ uses\_JESSICA\_as a blueprint for itself (right down to the brass rubbings in the graveyard, the attic antique dress-up/down and the weird ghostly whispers of her name) has to be doing something right. While these references are really all it has under\
      \ its sleeve, SWEET fits nicely next to recent work discussed elsewhere in this site, like\_AMER,\_THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY, HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and\_IT FOLLOWS,\_KISS OF THE DAMNED, THE STRANGE COLOR OF YOUR BODY'S TEARS, and Ann Biller's\_THE LOVE WITCH.\_\
      The emerging retro-modernists operate on the principle you've already seen the movies they love, and rather than remaking them or working around them, they incorporate their direct thematic tropes like colors on a palette or burglar tools to spring through\
      \ the vents along the smaller, horror fronts that uses retro-analog stylistics to intensify the melancholy of half-remembered small town isolation and in the process avoids the grisly gore or grinding sex (for the most part) of lesser mortal films, to\
      \ approach things from a more dreamy mixture of after-school special and women's lib horror with sapphic undertones.  The trying on old clothes in the Victorian attic with a possibly ageless vampire lesbian bit was, I thought, basically over in indie film\
      \ since all that great Victorian stuff finally fell apart (it lasted much longer than our modern pre-fab shit, which is why there was so much of it still around in the 70s when it would surface in films like Let's Scare Jessica to Dea You'd think was a\
      \ cinematographer branching out into film, a kind of Terence Malick of horror, rather than vice versa due to the continued emphasis on gorgeous composition and fading light indoors lit by a single multi-colored lamp, or a rotting pomegranate on a table\
      \ at night in a thunderstorm, all twisty and alive like a rotting old Dutch master's still-life.  \_At any rate, it's further proof that if you're a horror fan, Shudder is a must. (I subscribed via Amazon since it was already connected through my Blu-ray\
      \ player). Why? Because its selections isn't limited to new or old, familiar or odd, zero budget shorts or old silents; if a selection comes over from the festival circuit as a Shudder Exclusive you can bet it's worth your time, or really really terrible\
      \ but never boring or bland. A good example is\_this nod to the 60s-70s horror films of yore, mixing elements and themes, tropes tried and true.   Those who recognize all the quotes should have no problem respecting all this as homage as, for the most\
      \ part, Calvo quotes his sources like a man, a man who's not afraid of dipping his unmoored eye down into the split-feminine psyche (even the tale of the beach tryst lifted wholesale from PERSONA has an echo--in Godard's lifting Batailles' Story of the\
      \ Eye for a similar part of WEEKEND). People can argue about men so often doing split-subject female movies but I think it's natural, and too bad more women don't do the same with men, other than Kathryn Bigelow, whose HURT LOCKER is still probably the\
      \ most profound movie about the masculine psyche since Hawks. From a Jungian archetypal perspective, our creative soul is always the opposite gender from ourselves, and in dreams very seldom appears to us in the same guise twice; the subconscious ego/anima\
      \ of every sane man is an insane woman or vice versa; the Jane Eyre attic Mrs. Rochester gets wilder and more dangerous the more 'mastery' he exhibits over the downstairs. A fully-integrated self, like Jane, gets her animus (Rochester) in orbit with his\
      \ own anima (shit gets complicated when dealing with your unconscious ego's unconscious anima -- all demons are haunted by their inner angel dream master, and vice versa). Things may wobble but they inevitably balance in the end (or else just keep wobbling).\
      \ The nature of the universe, gravitational pulls spinning everything madly around on both sub-atomic and macro-galaxial reality level, everything interlocked and reflected so that a single \_coincidental blip can echo across all of space and history simultaneously\
      \ (a young King Tut gets a headache four thousand ears ago because you suddenly had deja vu when a girl fell and dropped her kite string both yesterday and two years from now ago). As the enigmatic Beth, Shepherd is both alive/seductive and zombie-like\
      \ her motives stay shadowy even as we feel ourselves, through Adele, falling in love with her. She not only lifts that sexy beach narrative in PERSONA but notes the Jane Eyre reference herself. She's hip about the archetypal madwoman in the attic refractions,\
      \ for what it's worth.    But it's the truly unnerving work by Wilhelmi that lingers in the mind--with a face that seems at times very old and others like a child, she has a cursory resemblance to Heather Graham, like the home-schooled little sister.We\
      \ admire her relentless good cheer in the face of utter ambivalence from both mom and aunt and wonder how quickly we'd lapse into morose depression in similar circumstances (or maybe already have) so her ability to keep trying wins us over and then--when\
      \ she gets slightly bonkers--we realize we're already in too deep to escape. We thought we were escaping anyway coming here.    The only drawbacks to my mind are 1) yet another in the decade's apparently inexhaustible joyless HBO-brand rutting smash-cuts\
      \ to signify a kind of depressed ambivalence (you know the kind, a girl and guy meet for the first time and we smash cut to the girl's expressionless face as the dude mechanically ruts at her from behind like some spastic dog). and 2) the Lite FM 70s hits\
      \ by the likes of Classic IV, Bread (cover), Lobo, and the unfortunately-named Starbuck (\"Moonlight Feels Right\") which feels kind of like a missed opportunity. Music is so integral to doing these retro films right, and one dreads to imagine similar\
      \ music choices burdening the amazing analog synth scores of Disasterpiece (IT FOLLOWS),\_Tom Raybould (THE MACHINE), Dixon and Stein (STRANGER THINGS), Sinoa Caves (BEYOND THE BLACK RAINBOW), The Gifted (SOUTHBOUND) and so forth, and I get all weak in\
      \ the knees. I think of the score here vs. what it could be and I get a wee sad. Joe Carrano' relies instead high overly familiar eerie string sustains and scales, bongos and rattles making one wonder if they weren't secretly culled from some 70s PD cue\
      \ library. Sound mixing is sometimes totally trippy over small details, then trip over itself on big. The tinkling bell outside the aunt's room should have been a big shock (since she's dead), but it's buried under a cascade of other moments and the generic\
      \ mess of piano mashes and stuttering drums and Beth whispering her name close into the mike, \"Adele...\" So we're not sure what we're supposed to be afraid of - it's all hitting at once, tumbling in on us. We expect a bunch of deformed circus performers\
      \ to come out of the walls with knives in their teeth like in THE SENTINEL or FREAKS.  But those are the only real two complaints. All in all I'll forgive it a lack of point or logic as I appreciate the lack of torture porn, imprisonment, MISERY-style\
      \ sadism, and progressive isolation (i.e abuse) or moping. And I do love the imagery; it's not like the theme of doubling and splitting of the feminine psyche doesn't beg for and incorporate well all subsequent thematic variations so one can't fault it\
      \ for being familiar at the expense of coherence. Let's face it, clarity is a linear phallic male construct and it ain't artsy. It's not like we learn at the end of VERTIGO if Jimmy Stewart has been dead all this time from a great fall (we never see him\
      \ rescued). It's not needed--it's the difference between a 'twist' like in THE SIXTH SENSE and 'art' like in POINT-BLANK --if you need an answer as to whether Walker is alive or dead then man you're a square! The narrative here is similarly ambiguous,\
      \ the way the monster of the climactic basement scene stay in the shadows, out of focus, looking like some weird lizard rainforest shaman, it's never clearly defined, was it even there --does Calvo even know what's going on? Who complains is not artsy\
      \ - and he who is artsy, um... man, listen, man. I don't mind, man, that even unto the last frame we're never quite sure--anymore than Adele is--what is real, and at the very end, one more final reference, CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE (1944, below) bring the\
      \ Val Lewton savvy full fore. Situation complete. I think? Wait, what? Is that her, I can't even tell? Or is it the same picture from LOST HIGHWAY?   Shudder being worth getting at $4.99 a month is affirmed. One wonders just where GIRL might have wound\
      \ up without it. So often these films get either ignored at the festivals (by distributors who aren't quite sure how to market them), or bought up and then relegated to the shelves for years by groups like Lions Gate or IFC, when the person who bought\
      \ the rights leaves the firm before he or she can figure out how best to monetize it. Or some brave executive demands it make sense or have a point before sinking advertising into it. Shudder is there to do a rare and important job, to actually pay attention\
      \ to the quality of what they're getting rather than what they think they can promote. Not to say there ain't a shair fare of shiite, but Satan bless them, now and forever. In our loneliness and despair, the devil sent us a friend. Whether or not this\
      \ Sweet, Sweet Lonely Girl is real or just a homicidal amalgam of past images, reflections and hazy memories, riffs on photos both still and in motion, we'll take her.     See also: Naomi Watt's Post-Modern Mother of MirrorsGenealogy of Flies: HOUSE OF\

      \ Ready For New Kids, Paula Abdul &amp; Boyz II Men by Listening to the NEW Arena Guy Spotify Playlist!</title><text>Excitement continues to build for the “Total Package Tour,” which will kick off their North American Summer Tour at the Schottenstein Center\
      \ on Friday, May 12! With the concert featuring New Kids on the Block, Paula Abdul and Boyz II Men, it will be more than a “Block Party!” It will be “Straight Up” fun to experience the energy, unique choreography and classic hits from the three music legends.\
      \ While NKOTB and Boyz II Men toured together during their 2013 “Package Tour,” this will be the first time Paula Abdul will have performed in concert in 25 years and the anticipation is high! This concert is the “Total Package” and it is certain fans\
      \ will be wanting more when the concert comes to the “End of the Road.” \r\n“The Total Package Tour” is a live-in-concert representation of what artists and music dominated the pop charts in the late-80’s and the 90’s! The three stars collectively sold\
      \ an impressive 193 million albums worldwide! Every one of NKOTB’s albums experienced great sales and success on the charts. Their debut album “New Kids on the Block” went triple platinum! The follow-up, “Hangin’ Tough,” went 8 times platnium and “Step\
      \ By Step” went triple platinum! “Hangin’ Tough” and “Step by Step” both reached number one! Jordan, Danny, Joey, Donny and Jonathan were the originators of what would become the newest boy band craze featuring talented vocalists, dancers and catchy pop\
      \ hits. \r\nPaula Abdul, the former dancer, choreographer and Los Angeles Lakers cheerleader, became one of the most successful female artists of all-time with seven of her 13 Top 40 hits reaching #1!! Boyz II Men’s unique style combines old school R&amp;B,\
      \ acapella and pop. Their 19 Top 40 hits and #1 hits like “End of the Road,” “On Bended Knee,” “I’ll Make Love to You,” and “It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday” resulted in the band being one of the most successful vocal groups ever. \r\nTo help\

      ton. While it wasn’t a national hit, “Be My Girl,”\_ became a fan favorite and a hidden treasure which would build the foundation for what was to come! \r\n\r\n “Cover Girl” New Kids On The Block \r\n\r\nThe fifth track on NKOTB’s multi-platinum album\
      \ “Hangin’ Tough” reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart, and was even covered by South Korean artist Lee Min Woo in 2006. \r\n\r\n “The Way That You Love Me” Paula Abdul\r\n\r\nFrom her debut album “Forever Your Girl.” Primarily a hip-hop\
      \ dancer, the song’s music video was the first time Paula was featured tap-dancing! The song was released twice; the second time was a charm as it reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 a year after its original release! \r\n\r\n “Motownphilly”\
      \ Boyz II Men\r\n\r\nThis tribute to Motown and Philadelphia is the first track on Boyz II Men’s debut album “Cooleyhighharmony,” and reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. “Motownphilly” became a theme song at the 2016 Democratic National\
      \ Convention, which was hosted in Philadelphia. \r\n\r\n “You Got It (The Right Stuff)”\_\_\_\_ New Kids On The Block\r\n\r\nThe second single from the “Hangin’ Tough” album reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, and was also a major\
      \ hit internationally in eight countries, including number one in the UK and Australia. Their Spanish version “Autentica” reached number 11 in Spain. \r\n\r\n “Cold Hearted” Paula Abdul\r\n\r\nThe third single from the “Forever Your Girl” album to become\
      \ a number one single. The music video was inspired by the choreography of the “Take Off With Us” scene in the movie, “All That Jazz.” \r\n\r\n “Tonight”\_\_\_\_ New Kids On The Block\r\n\r\nReleased at the peak of the group’s commercial success, the song\
      \ peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the U.K. Singles Chart. “Tonight” is the band’s appreciative tribute to their fans. \r\n\r\n “End of the Road” Boyz II Men\r\n\r\nThe song held its place at number one on the Billboard\
      \ Hot 100 chart for a record breaking thirteen weeks. It was recorded by Boyz II Men for the soundtrack Boomerang which gained the group international success.  \r\n\r\n “I’ll Be Loving You (Forever)”\_\_\_\_ New Kids On The Block\r\n\r\nThis ballad was\
      \ the song of the summer in 1989 reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and number five in the U.K.. Between the two countries, the single sold 535,000 copies. \r\n\r\n “Forever Your Girl” Paula Abdul\r\n\r\nAbdul’s fourth single was released in\
      \ 1989, and became the second number one single from the “Forever Your Girl” album. The song is about remaining loyal in a relationship— a trait which Abdul highly values. \r\n\r\n “If You Go Away”\_\_\_\_ New Kids On The Block\r\n\r\nReleased as a stand-alone\
      \ single, the song reached the Top 20 in 1991. \r\n\r\n “I’ll Make Love To You.”\_\_\_\_ Boyz II Men\r\n\r\nBoyz II Men reclaimed their place at number one with “I’ll Make Love To You.” The song tied Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You” by remaining\
      \ number one for fourteen consecutive weeks. The band would then break their own record in 1996, with the release of “One Sweet Day,” a collaboration with Mariah Carey, which remained number one for sixteen weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. \r\n\r\n\
      \ “Please Don’t Go Girl”\_\_\_\_ New Kids On The Block\r\n\r\nThe group’s first commercial hit from their second album “Hangin’ Tough.” A Florida radio station was the first to play the single, which helped launch the group into national stardom. \r\n\r\
      \n “Straight Up”\_\_\_\_ Paula Abdul\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Abdul received widespread attention and became an instant star when “Straight Up” hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100. She loved the song after hearing the demo, but had to fight with\
      \ producers to go in the studio to record the track . They didn’t think it would sell, but ten days after its release the song had sold a million copies, would go number one and become her signature hit. \r\n\r\n “Hangin’ Tough”\_\_\_\_ New Kids On The\
      \ Block\r\n\r\nAs the fourth single from the NKOTB’s album sharing the same name, “Hangin’ Tough” became a number one hit in the US, UK, Ireland, and reached the top ten in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. \r\n\r\n “It’s So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday”\
      \_\_\_\_ Boyz II Men\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This song was originally written for the movie “Cooley High” and was sung by G.C. Cameron. Sixteen years later, Boyz II Men released their rendition on their album “Cooleyhighharmony,” named after the\
      \ movie, and topped numerous charts in the US. \r\n\r\n “Step by Step”\_\_\_\_ New Kids On The Block\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ The biggest-selling single of NKOTB’s career sold ten million copies worldwide. The song was voted as the fourth “Best Boy\
      \ Band Song Ever” in a Smash Hits poll. \r\n\r\n “Opposites Attract” Paula Abdul\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ The sixth and final single from the “Forever Your Girl” album reached number one in the US, Canada, and Australia. In the music video for the\
      \ song, Abdul dances with cartoon character MC Skat Cat. The idea was inspired by the scene of Gene Kelly’s film “Anchors Aweigh” where he dances with Jerry of Tom and Jerry. Abdul choreographed not only her own live-action dance moves, but also MC Skat\
      \ Cat’s movements to match her. \r\n\r\n “On Bended Knee”\_\_\_\_ Boyz II Men\r\n\r\nThis song about forgiveness and respect within a relationship held its place at number one on the Hot 100 Airplay chart for six weeks. “On Bended Knee” also replaced their\
      \ own song “I’ll Make Love To You” at the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100. The Beatles were the only group at the time to have done the same. \r\n\r\n “Didn’t I (Blow Your Mind)\_\_\_\_ New Kids On The Block\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Originally\
