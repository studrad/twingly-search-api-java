      \ Muskets – Chew.</title><text>Muskets this week release new album, Chew through No Sleep Records. Soon to be on tour with Wallflower across the UK and recently on the road with Tiger’s Jaw, this band have been busy and this album shows why. You’re So\
      \ Cool, the band’s first single can be heard on Spotify here. \r\nThe grunge sound suits them and it shows straight from the start. Bringing in sounds and cool guitars that give these tracks bursts of energy in all the right moments, Muskets certainly\
      \ can craft a melody. Tracks such as 17 Years make this perfectly clear as the band bring that heavy mood and guitars that just amplify the sound. \r\nThis band match the high standard of their melodies with their huge choruses and vocals that deliver\
      \ them on every song. Decay for those reasons stands out early in the album and this continues throughout, in particular Breathing. Vocally this album\_works and considering the melodies were made on the spot in the studio the harmonies on this record\
      \ sound awesome, the album working together incredibly well. \r\nA debut album to be proud of, Muskets make an album that brings those Fugazi, Nirvana inspired sounds together with incredible talent. Guitars that throb throughout these tracks lifting the\
      \ energy incredibly in moments and vocals that sound so good, this is a great listen. Highlights on this album are Decay, Frankie Stable and 17 Years for me, this band make it clear just what they can do, and I look forward to more from these guys. \r\n\

      \ importance of fika time to a startup</title><text>My newest venture, thestartupfactory.tech, https://thestartupfactory.tech/ has been up and running for three months now, and we’re in good nick, building our confidence, rhythm, spirit, cadence and culture.\
      \ We’re a team of passionate folk who work with tech startups to turn their vision into a reality, enabling innovation and customer-centred thinking into their new tech product and business. \r\nWe’re entrepreneurs, software engineers, designers, analysts,\
      \ and agile practitioners. We’re also bloggers, explorers, speakers, swimmers, dog lovers, coffee addicts, campers, walkers, musicians, gamers, footballers, readers, travellers, gardeners, parents, and optimists. \r\nThat list is about ‘who we are’. We\
      \ bring our true selves to work. Our business is defined by who we are, our values and the culture we create. More grit than glamour, we’re built on the spirit and down-to-earthiness of Manchester, ‘factory’ being an acknowledgment of the industrial heritage\
      \ of what made Manchester special, and also taking the disruption, innovation and ethos of one of the city’s most evocative businesses, Factory Records. \r\nWith an attitude of graft and guile, we are factory workers, we get our hands into the machinery\
      \ of building a startup, we roll our sleeves up, get dirt under our nails and get stuck in. \r\nThe essential moving parts of any startup are the people capital, not the venture capital, as Drucker said, culture eats strategy for breakfast, and we’ve spent\
      \ time thinking and building our culture ahead of any rush to market. \r\nWhen setting out on our venture, we looked to other entrepreneurs for a steer as to what makes for a happy and healthy business. We found this quote from Jeff Bezos: Find the things\
      \ that are important to you and invest heavily in those things. \r\nSo we created the Five Pillars, to stay focused on a list of meaningful things that created and sustained intimacy and interaction between us, and connected us at a personal level. I spend\
      \ more time with the team that I do with my dog, so there had to be reason to be here. \r\nSo here is the list of Five Pillars, it’s on our web site. \r\nVision &amp; Values \r\n\r\nOur business is about people capital, not venture capital\r\nReach beyond\
      \ your expectations, every day\r\nFirst names are important, job titles are not\r\nTrusting each other is the platform for everything we do\r\nEveryone practices humility and self awareness, but also self-esteem\r\nWe know the mentality to be successful\
      \ and we have it in abundance\r\n\r\nCulture \r\n\r\nNo office hours, but minds always open\r\n40 hours a week maximum; 32 summer hours – 4 day weeks, July &amp; August\r\nWeekend starts 1pm Friday\r\nWe pay for one weekend holiday a year for everyone\r\
      \nFresh fruit breakfast in the office every day; pay for a weekly ‘Hello Fresh’ shop once a month\r\nTeam social last Thursday of every month\r\n\r\nKnowledge \r\n\r\nEveryone has a personal R&amp;D project\r\nHost Lunch &amp; Learns third Thursday in\
      \ the month\r\nRun four hackathons a year\r\nWednesday afternoon is your personal learning time\r\nEveryone goes to one event a month; everyone has a monthly book allowance\r\nPerformance of the business is transparent to everyone\r\n\r\nSocial impact\
      \ \r\n\r\nLead a Code school in Manchester for under 11s\r\nProvide a platform for unemployed people to get back into work\r\nSponsor &amp; help the homeless in Manchester\r\nMentor a Social Enterprise\r\nProvide paid internship opportunities\r\nBe an\
      \ active contributor to Manchester Tech Trust\r\n\r\nSuccess \r\n\r\nWe will keep our company small and intimate, with reasonable expectations\r\nOur place of work is a welcoming oasis, not a chaotic kitchen\r\nAnxiety is not a pre-requisite for progress\r\
      \nWe are calm by choice and practice\r\nEverything is about having a reasonable day, going home, and living your life\r\nSuccess is looking at a visible horizon, and getting there in the long run\r\n\r\nWe’ve not done everything yet, there’s a few wrinkles\
      \ and edges to sort as we’re not doing some things as well as we can, but the Five Pillars gives us clarity and purpose about our direction. \r\nI’ve long been interested in entrepreneurial cultures and the underlying philosophies, how you create the conditions\
      \ to spark a startup based on the emotional intelligence and connectivity of the people. We’re more reflective than rebels, and on crafting the Five Pillars came across a concept from Ikea, ‘fika’, which we’ve implemented. \r\nAt 9.45am every day, we have\
      \ ‘fika’ time. We each stop what we are doing and huddle around a table, have a cup of tea or coffee, and just be with each other. We chat about anything and everything but work. Friday was about Chuck’s pending house move; James neglecting his desk cactus;\
      \ Jake’s obsession with 3D printing; and my ridiculous new waistcoat wardrobe. We also get loud about curating our tsf.tech Spotify list. \r\nWhat we sample is an experience and unique word at the heart of Swedish life and work – ‘fika’ (pronounced ‘fee-ka’\
      ). According to the Swedish Culture website it is described in this way: \r\nSwedes prefer not to translate the word fika. They don’t want it to lose significance and become a mere coffee break. Fika is much more than having a coffee. It is a social phenomenon,\
      \ a legitimate reason to set aside a moment for quality time. \r\nCoffee is traditionally at the heart of the fika. When coffee arrived in Sweden in 1685, it became so popular that it upset the rest of the import business. So much so that it was banned\
      \ five times in Swedish history! \r\nFika is a combination of the Swedish colloquial word for cafe – fik – and coffee – kaffe. Who knows, perhaps the term fika served as a kind of code for those who took part in this once illegal activity. It is said that\
      \ during the bans, Swedes were forced to drink their coffee secretly, out into the woods \r\nMaking time for fika is so sacred to Swedes that it’s built into many employee contracts. Some even say that the best ideas spring from fika breaks. We use fika\
      \ time to cultivate an almost tactile sense of connection, here’s what we are trying to bring into our business. \r\nCommunicate frequently and constantly In tsf.tech we are always active on collaboration tools like Jira, Zoom and Slack instant messenger.\
      \ Besides work content, we post links to interesting items, videos, learnings and stories. The point is that in the physical workplace we know we can relax and chat to people when we see them, but when we’re away from our work space and operating in the\
      \ more detached digital world, we need to work harder at connecting, talking and feeling close. Fika gives us this. \r\nBe open, vulnerable and honest Not every day is intense, but what works in the digital workplace is to reveal what matters to each of\
      \ us. Speaking in your own authentic voice is essential. Honesty creates intimacy in digital worlds just as much as it does in the physical. Connecting becomes a deliberate rather than assumed experience. In tsf.tech we say that you do not need to be present\
      \ physically but you do need to be present digitally, so if you can’t make fika face to face, connect using the tools. \r\nPlace your leadership front and centre The beauty of the digital workplace is that it has qualities that are impossible in the physical\
      \ world. So take IKEA for example. In the physical world, their leaders cannot be everywhere in person having coffee and chatter with colleagues. But in the digital world, through real-time and other collaborative services, they can be ‘felt’ across far\
      \ more frequently and with a much greater reach. But you have to invest time and authenticity in making it happen. \r\nUse all the technology you can to bring you closer In tsf.tech we grab every new tool that may make us slicker and faster, as well as\
      \ strengthen our bonds and connections. There is also a level of curiosity and experimenting. We do this because we like to be a ‘digital workplace lab’, we are in a position to experiment and innovate with new digital services in a way that large companies\
      \ may not be. With all the team save myself under twenty-six, they are ‘digital natives’ and have a natural instinct for UX and gamification. \r\nMake the social side of connection richer and deeper I dislike the term ‘social media’, it’s an oxymoron,\
      \ because it drives isolated experience and consumption, it connects but doesn’t create engagement. Social for me is sitting next to someone and talking, and the things we talk about and do that are explicitly not work – they are social. Yes, we use social\
      \ and online tools and the ways in which we use them are clear and distinct, engendering personal connection and relationships inside and outside the company. The point is we share our lives – issues, pets, families and homes. This generates the culture\
      \ of closeness that the Swedes so value. \r\nUse your own voice to talk and listen I mention voice particularly because on a phone call, Zoom or Webex we are talking and listening in reality. So far the only aspect of me as a human being that can be communicated\
      \ digitally in the same way as if we are sitting together is my own voice, tone, intonation. I believe how we listen also matters hugely and when someone is listening to another person attentively, the talker can see that quality of listening. This is\
      \ a key underpinning of fika. \r\nWe also have a ‘Your Voice’ item on our fortnightly team meeting agenda, when I encourage sharing ourselves with each other about how work ‘feels’. We also challenge each other and have debates and even arguments when\
      \ needed at fika time, but we do that using our own voices because our vocal cords and tone of voice are such a powerful and distinct part of who we each are. \r\nMeet in person when you can and make it matter Sometimes for some meetings this is not possible,\
      \ but using opportunities to meet face-to-face does make a difference. It’s easy to default to the smart tech tools, but if we can meet in person, it adds to the richness of relationship, looking people in the eye and getting a sense of their body language\
      \ is of much more value to see how we are. \r\nWhile fika is good for mental and physical wellness, offering a period of calmness in a busy working day schedule, it can also help us to stay focused in the long run. Research has shown that taking breaks\
      \ increases productivity. Sometimes, during the middle of a task,\_you might be stuck. With fika, you can have a break, come back refreshed and look at things from a different perspective. We insist that work talk is prohibited in fika. It forces you away\
      \ from your work so you can re-evaluate things, come back refreshed and prioritise tasks when you do return. \r\nSo another year, another Scandinavian lifestyle trend. In 2016, the UK was fascinated by\_the Danish practice of hygge (finding the simple\
      \ pleasure everyday life). For me, fika is an opportunity to slow down, come together for a face-to-face and interact. The social aspect of work is incredibly important. \r\nThe essential part is making a little space in your day to take a break. In our\
      \ modern, hectic lifestyles, this is the part that is important: that we take a few moments to slow down in our day and make time to just sit and appreciate the moment. \r\nSo, perhaps there are aspects of the IKEA fika around coffee and cake that you\
      \ can create inside your own digital enabled workplace, like we have in tsf.tech, to enable you to enjoy that atmosphere and chemistry of connection the Swedes love so much. The only part missing so far for us is the cake, but I guess we’ll just have to\
      \ wait for Jake’s 3D printing of food and add that to the digital workplace menu at tsf.tech fika meetings.</text><languageCode>en</languageCode><locationCode /><coordinates /><links><link>https://www.thestartupfactory.tech/</link><link>http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/fromthelighthouseblog.wordpress.com/1229</link></links><tags><tag>Agile\
