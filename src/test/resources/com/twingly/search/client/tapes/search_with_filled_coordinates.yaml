      \ Sprint in Louvain la Neuve (Oct 3 and 4, 2016)</title><text>All you wanted to know about the OCA code sprint\r\n\r\nbut were afraid to ask\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThe sprint starts on monday Oct 3, 9:00 and ends on\
      \ tuesday Oct 4, 18:00.\_ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThe sprint will be hosted at the Ibis Hotel in Louvain la Neuve. The hotel is at a 15 min walk from the Louvain la Neuve railway station, and about the same distance from\
      \ the Aula Magna where the Odoo Experience is being held later that week. If you want to drive there, the GPS coordinates are\_ 50.673359, 4.607381. \_ \r\n\r\nWe booked the same room as for last year's sprint. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat to bring?\r\n\r\n\r\n\
      \r\n \r\nBring your good spirit. \r\nBring your laptop. \r\nBe sure to bring an adapter if your local power plugs don't match belgian power sockets. If you come in a group, it's a good idea to bring a multi plug to share the power socket.\_ \r\nHaving\
      \ some paper and a pen is nice.\_ \r\nYou may want to bring an edible or drinkable delicacy from your home place to share with the other participants, but this is entirely optional.\_  \r\nThe hotel has a good WiFi installation. However, 60 persons trying\
      \ to clone large projects from github simultaneously is a problem. Please get ready in advance, and clone the repositories before leaving for the sprint: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/odoo/odoo\r\n\thttps://github.com/OCA/OCB\r\n\tthe various OCA projects\
      \ (hint : you can use the oca-clone-everything script from OCA/maintainer-tools)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have some kind of schedule?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nSure! \r\n\r\nBoth days should follow roughly the following plan: \r\n\r\n9h short start up speech, presentation\
      \ of the rules and sprint tracks\r\n\t9h30 - 12h30 code sprint\r\n\t12h30 - ~14h lunch break\r\n\t14h - 15h lightning talk track\r\n\t14h - 17h code sprint\r\n\t17h - 18h presentation of achievements by each sprint track\_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat will we eat?\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThat's a very important question! \r\n\r\nThe OCA will cover the costs of the lunches and coffee break, and the hotel restaurant is pretty good. \r\n\r\nThere are no plans for dinners, but you will need to plan to handle this by yourself.\_\
      \ \r\n\r\nIf there are things you cannot eat for some reason, please send an email to alexandre.fayolle at camptocamp.com.\_ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat will be the sprint tracks?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the feedback received on the registration form here are\
      \ the sprint tracks attendees are proposing to manage: \r\n\r\nWebsite CMS improvements (Simone Orsi)\r\n\tOpenDocument based reporting engine (Alexis de Lattre): there is one important topic I would like to achieve: decide which OpenDocument-based reporting\
      \ engine we include in the OCA.\r\n\tElectronic invoicing (Alexis de Lattre)\r\n\tRefactor Geoengine by migrating it to OpenLayers 3 (oca/geospatial) (Yannick Vaucher): the work was started on Odoo 8 but is now stalled. Plus, Geoengine has seen some features\
      \ this year making it greater, but on deprecated OpenLayers 2.\_ I'd like to continue this refactoring and maybe get a first version without all the functionalities we go with OL2.\r\n\tContributors stats gathering module (Maxime Chambreuil): OCA devs\
      \ like contributors stats !\r\n\tGetting to know the OCA Developpment Workflow (Robert Rottermann)\_\r\n\tdocument_sftp (Holger Brunn): I'd work on https://github.com/OCA/knowledge/tree/8.0/document_sftp. Or maybe implement a ssh server so that we can\
      \ provide a shell with some odoo specific commands, so that we can write shell scripts doing odoo stuff while being authenticated with an ssh key\r\n\tStocks logistics barcode scanning (Aaron Henriquez): Move to v9.\r\n\tImprove the Business Requirement\
      \ set of modules (Eric Caudal)\r\n\tmobile community interface (Jairo Llopis):\_ polish the interface and create an addon that leverages the power of CoffeScript for Odoo (similar to website_less, but for CS).\r\n\tDockerizing the runbot (Alexandre Fayolle,\
      \ Moisés López and Dave Lasley)\r\n\tmackma project (Frederik Kramer):\_ work on www.mackma-project.eu an European Reasearch Project on Knowledge Mangement with Odoo\_\r\n\tsetuptools-odoo (Stéphane Bidoul): eg\_update travis script to use it instead of\
      \ oca-dependencies.txt, push to pypi, support Odoo 10, etc\r\n \r\nThere will probably be some tracks to perform code reviews, process pending PRs, port addons to newer Odoo releases.\_  \r\nWe will also have some lightning talks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLightning\
      \ talks? What's that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA lightning talk session is a 1h track where people get a 5min slot to show and tell about a topic of their choice. The time constraint is everything, 5min is all you get (and we have a stop watch), so be sure to rehease\
      \ a bit. You will get an opportunity to propose talks at the last minute.\_ \r\n\r\nHere's a list of talks participants proposed in the poll: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow to document your module for all end users profit\r\n\tImprovements in bank-payment in v9\
      \ ?\r\n\tOdoo_Instances a toolset to setup and deoploy Odoo using docker\r\n\tdocument_sftp\r\n\tInventory Revaluation module\r\n\tIf I get the coffeescript toolchain working, then I'd love to present it in 5 minutes :)\r\n\tE-commerce alternative based\
      \ on odoo and locootivecms.\_\r\n\tVoodoo a tool to develop and deploy easily odoo\r\n\tDevops Used at Vauxoo\r\n\tAbout new addons social/mail_tracking*\r\n\tUnit test odoo report\r\n\tbase_custom_info and base_multi_image generic mixins\r\n\tweb_timeline\r\
      \n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny other question?\r\n\r\nask it on the contributors mailing list !\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to seeing you all in Louvain la Neuve!</text><languageCode>en</languageCode><locationCode>ru</locationCode><coordinates><latitude>49.1</latitude><longitude>10.75</longitude></coordinates><links><link>http://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-2200-ibis-styles-meeting-center-louvain-la-neuve</link><link>http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/356183421#map=17/50.67292/4.61226</link><link>http://www.ahstatic.com/photos/2200_sm_02_p_1024x768.jpg</link><link>http://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/belgium</link><link>https://www.github.com/odoo/odoo</link><link>https://www.github.com/OCA/OCB</link><link>https://www.github.com/OCA/maintainer-tools</link><link>https://www.github.com/OCA/knowledge/tree/8.0/document_sftp</link><link>http://www.mackma-project.eu/</link></links><tags><tag>OCA\
